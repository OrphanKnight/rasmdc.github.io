								<h3>What is SumoBots?</h3>
                                
								<p>Two robots competing in a head-to-head match following the basic system of traditional human sumo matches.  Robots are allowed no weapons, and are not allowed to flip each other.  The sole purpose is a pushing match between the two robots to force the other from the arena.  Multiple weight classes and control systems are allowed (autonomous compete against autonomous and R/C against R/C - they are separate classes and do not compete against each other.)
                                </p>

											<li>Devices that can store liquid, powder, gas or other substances for throwing at the opponent are not allowed.</li>
											<li>Any flaming devices are not allowed.</li>
											<li>Devices that throw things at your opponent are not allowed.</li>
											<li>Sticky substances to improve traction are not allowed. Tires and other components of the robot in contact with the ring must not be able to pick up and hold a standard 3"x5" index card for more than two seconds.</li>
											<li>Devices to increase down force, such as a vacuum pump or magnets, are only allowed in the 3 kg class. They are not allowed in all other classes.</li>
											<li>All edges, including but not limited to the front scoop, must not be sharp enough to scratch or damage the ring, other robots, or players. In general, edges with a radius of greater than .005", as would be obtained with a unsharpened .010" thick metal strip, should be ok.

											<li>One match shall consist of 3 rounds, within a total time of 3 minutes, unless extended by the judges.</li>
											<li>The team who wins two rounds or receives two "Yuhkoh" points first, within the time limit, shall win the match. A team receives a "Yuhkoh" point when they win a round. If the time limit is reached before one team can get two "Yuhkoh" points, and one of the teams has received one Yuhkoh point, the team with one Yuhkoh point shall win.</li>
											<li>When the match is not won by either team within the time limit, an extended match may be fought, during which the team who receives the first Yuhkoh point shall win. Alternatively, the winner/loser of the match may be decided by judges, by means of lots, or by a rematch.</li>

								<p>[Start] Upon the judge's instructions, the two teams bow to each other in the outer ring, approach the ring, and place a robot within their half of the ring on or behind the Shikiri line. (A robot or a part of a robot may not be placed beyond the front edge of the Shikiri line toward the opponent. Note that is not required that a robot be placed directly behind the Shikiri line; it may be offset to the side, as long as it is behind an imaginary line collinear with the Shikiri line.) When the judge announces the start of the round, the teams start their robots, and after a five second pause the robots may start operating. During these five seconds, players must clear out of the ring area.</p>
